There is no mandatory field check for POST Eg: firstname and lastname at least one of it should be mandatory for a succesful booking but we can book with both empty.
There is no mandatory field check for PUT similar behaviour as above.
Check in date can be after check out date which should not be allowed.
Past dates are allowed for check out.
Check in and check out should have a limit like for the next 2 years or so right now there is no validation.
There is no validation for the price and deposit fields which should be there. Eg: When deposit is true price should not be 0.
